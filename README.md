# Estate-Server

As part of the Ch√¢Top project, this is the server part of the project.
It is a RESTful API that is used to store and retrieve data from the Estate database.

The front part is available here : [Estate-Front](https://github.com/ThomasBTR/estate-front) forked from OpenClassRooms projects.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

- Get the git repository with the following command :

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ThomasBTR/estate-server.git
    ```

- Go to the docker compose folder

    ```bash
    cd docker
    ```  

- Run the following command to start the database and the minio server

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

- Go to the project folder

    ```bash
    cd estate-server
    ```
- Run the following command to install the project

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
- Run the following command to run the project

    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ``` 

- The project is now running on  [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
- The documentation is available on [http://localhost:3001/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:3001/swagger-ui/index.html)
- The API documentation is available on [http://localhost:3001/api/v1/docs](http://localhost:3001/api/v1/docs)
- The database is running on [http://localhost:3306](http://localhost:3306)
  - The database default root user is : *root* and the password is : *root*
- The minio server is running on [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)
  - the minio default user is : *estate-admin* and the password is : *estate-minio-secret-key*


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

You will need for this project :

- [maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) to build the project (current : 3.6.3)
- [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html) to run the project (current : openjdk 17.0.6 2023-01-17)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to run the database and the minio server (current : 23.0.2, build 569dd73)

### The database and minio server

To simulate the database and the minio server, we will use docker.
Using a docker compose file, I set up the MySql database and a minio server to reproduce an object storage container.
The minio server can be replaced by an AWS S3 bucket.

#### What you will found

- In the ./docker/ folder, you will find :
  - the docker-compose.yml file that will run the database and the minio server.
  - the ./docker/.env file that contains the environment variables for the database and the minio server.

#### Environment variables

Everything is commented, so you can easily understand what is going on.

- The environment variables are defined in the ./docker/.env file.
- The variables for spring are defined in the ./src/main/resources/application.yaml file.
- Estate peculiar variables are the following :

```yaml
...
estate:
  jwt:
    expiration: 86400000 # 1 day
  minio:
    endpoint: http://localhost # Minio server url
    port: 9000 # Minio server port
    user: estate-admin # Minio root user
    password: estate-minio-secret-key # Minio root password
    bucket: estate-images # Minio bucket name
    retentionHours: 24 # Minio bucket object retention hours
...
```

#### Running and stopping the database and the minio server with docker compose

- Go to ./docker/, run the following command :

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

- To stop the database and the minio server, run the following command :

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

### Installing the project

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

- To quickly run all maven cycle on this project, run the following command :

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

- Run the following command to only package the project

    ```bash
    mvn clean package
    ```

## Getting started with the API

The documentation is based on the [spring doc](https://springdoc.org/v2/) specification.

Configured endpoints are defined in the application.yaml as follows :

```yaml
springdoc:
  api-docs:
    path: /api/v1/docs
  swagger-ui:
    path: /swagger-ui
```

### A fair warning :

***A specific endpoint is defined in configuration to get the documentation of the API out of the security scope.
This is done only for demonstration purpose, in a real world application, the documentation should be secured.***

The documentation path is defined per se in spring-doc specification of
the [swagger-ui](https://springdoc.org/v2/#getting-started)
and [api-docs](https://springdoc.org/v2/#spring-webmvc-support) endpoints.

For example, if you run on your machine without changing the server port, the documentation will be available
here: http://localhost:3001/swagger-ui/index.html
and you will get the API documentation from this link : http://localhost:3001/api/v1/docs

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests - currently not implemented

The only test implemented are unit tests for spring starting purpose.
Unit test are not on the scope of this project.

- Run the following command to only run the unit tests
    ```bash
    mvn clean test
    ```

### Break down into end-to-end tests - currently not implemented

End to end or integration tests are not on the scope of this project.

## Deployment -currently not implemented

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
